I have a strong belief that as long as people can get emotions, then marketing should be the foundation of everything.
I enjoy writing both in my job and for fun. I'm skilled at strategic communication using my pen( or keypad as the case may be).
One thing you should know is that I can easily separate my love for writing (literally) from my love of penning great copies.
Other skills I love to brag about include; Content Creation, SEO, Ads, and data analysis.
