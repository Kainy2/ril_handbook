I am a software developer with web knowledge in systems architecture and infrastructure experience, 
I actually started coding with my cellphone back in 2018, before I could eventually afford a laptop. I posses the ability to learn, unlearn and re-learn.

I am also continuously learning and improving my skills as I hope to grow in the DevOps role, learning technologies likes, Docker and Kubernetes.
