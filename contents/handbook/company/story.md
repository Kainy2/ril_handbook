## 2019
In 2019, our founder Joseph realized that in spite of the increasing supply of young talents in the region only a few had the opportunities to grow and explore their innovative ideas. It was out of this great need that RIL was born. That same year, we partnered with other tech communities in Port Harcourt for the international space apps challenge.


## 2020
RIL has been on a mission to revolutionize Africa’s tech space with disrupting innovations and solutions to the biggest issues. We’ve invested heavily to nurture local talents. We have supported collaborations in building ground-up solutions that have authentic value to Africans.


## 2021
In 2021, we launched our fellowship program which was designed to unite young innovators. We trained over 25 innovators, providing them with resources including access to industry experts. Some of these young innovators are currently employed by international partner organizations using the skills learnt under us.

## 2022
With a proven track record of success in collaboration and nurturing tech talents, we launched the RILearn program. With this program, we have trained 15 in our bootcamp and 11 young teens and children talents via our Kids in Tech programs. We hosted various tech events including, Motion Design Experience (MDX), React Event and the RILExpo. We have fostered career development via our online communities and RILdiscuss.





## Motion Design Experience
The year paced up rather quickly and we had our first event in June. Motion design experience(MDX) which was held on the 30th of June was a partnered event with the motion design community in Port Harcourt. As one of the biggest tech events in Port Harcourt this year, here’s what some of the attendees had to say about it.

## Summer Class
We kicked off our Kids in Tech program in July, and we were thrilled about introducing tech to kids. We had a total of 13 kids separated into Frontend development and Product Design. In just one month, these kids managed to build landing pages and design apps respectively.

## Bootcamp
Our Bootcamp was started to create a community for newbies interested in getting introduced to the magical world of tech. In three months, we took a total of 15 innovators from enthusiasts to intermediate.

## React Meetup
The react meetup was hosted because we noticed a growing react community in Port Harcourt and as a company that loves react, we wanted to meet with the family.

## RIL Discuss
RIL Discuss is our Twitter space that holds two Fridays every month. This is where we reach our community and offer everyone a platform to contribute, collaborate, and ask questions. RIL discuss hosted some awesome topics and speakers this year.
Our product team weren’t left out of the fun either. We worked on a couple of innovative projects this year.
