## Wireframe Design Guidelines

### How do you create ubiquitous designs and be device ### agnostic? Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Treat my mobile designs as if designing for mobile web--Use an artboard width of 375, which works for most modern iPhone models and Android.
2. Manage the screen shape of the iPhone X and iPhone 11 by telling the dev team to just extend the header background color to the top.
3. Only use gestures that are universal, e.g. tap, swipe, press and hold. Focus on the best user experience regardless of OS.
4. Use SVGs for all icons and logos so that they look great on any screen resolution.
5. Use navigation and menu structures that are universal and not too OS specific.
