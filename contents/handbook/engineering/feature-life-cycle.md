## Purpose

> This document serves as a guide to the step-by-step process through which a project goes from the idea phase to implementation. It details the specific assignments, corresponding assigned roles, as well as the workflow analysis.
>

## Scope


> This SOP covers the end-to-end process from idea proposals to planning and all through to completion of the projects. The details within will help to maximize productivity and ensure strict compliance to standard.

## Responsibilities
- **Executive Chairman:** Final decision maker, Budget approval.
- **General Manager:** Ensures smooth running of personnel and activities required to keep up with project success.
- **Product Manager:** In charge of coordinating several products, and aligning with RIL objectives
- **Project Manager:** Directly responsible for coordinating the different phases of a project.
- **Chief Technology officer:** Tasked with ensuring the most suitable technologies and tools are used in implementing any project.
- **End User:** Prospective customer or product user.

### 1. **SPECIFIC PROCEDURE**

- Project Initialization
- Project Planning
- Project Execution
- Project Testing
- Project Closing

### PROCEDURE BREAKDOWN
Initialization:

- To determine a product or new feature to be adapted, the product team has to ensure that it solves a consumer/user challenge.
- The product manager carries out discussion and surveys with the end users in order to ascertain the problem that requires a new feature or product solution.
- From the result of the above, the proposed solution is determined by the product team, and a product strategy is developed.
- The product manager then goes ahead to create a Product Requirement Document (PRD) and User stories
- Based on the user stories, detailed responsibility and action plan for developers are determined.
- The product designer then creates the necessary wireframe and a high fidelity prototype
- The product team comprising of the product manager, designers and at least a member of the engineering team sits to make sure the High-Fidelity Prototype solves the intended problem

Planning

- Approvals are obtained from the entire board and stakeholders comprising (Exec. Chair, GM, Product Manager, Project Manager, CTO, and end user).
- On the approval, the Project manager is expected to come up with the roadmap, development technical requirement and budget.

***In the advent of a change in User requirement, or halt in product/feature, the Process begins again from Initialization.***

- The Project manager must make sure that all changes made during the planning phase go through the initiation process

Project Execution

- The project is broken down into epics, then user stories are assigned to the members of the Engineering team
- Weekly sprints will be created for the project detailing tasks to be completed by each team member
- Members of the project team are expected to use JIRA in updating their progress on the project. JIRA also serves as a tracking tool for the Project Manager.
- Members of the project team are also expected to use Slack for their daily standups
- Project reviews will be conducted on Mondays and Retrospectives will be conducted on Fridays
- The Project manager is to create weekly progress reports based on updates on JIRA. This report would be used by the Product Manager and other members of the board to track project success.

Project Testing

- Project testing is to be carried out by the stakeholders. (A testing committee if available or the GM, Program Manager, CTO, members of the product team and end user), to ensure it solves the actual problem It was intended to solve.
- The product team ensures that the product/feature meets the requirements stated at the initialization and planning phases.
- On entire stakeholder approval, the product/feature may be deployed or mass produced.

***In the event that a product/feature isn’t approved, the product team determines changes to be made and forwards them to the project manager who specifies “who does what” in the engineering team.***

Project closing

- Ensure all documentation is put in place to ensure easy reference when necessary.
