# Sales

**Overall Strategy**

- The number 1 goal of sales is to close customer deals, thus bringing revenue to the business.
- Every member of the sales team is in a closing role. Inbound and outbound leads are acquired by the marketing team.
- Sales is based around building trust and respect with customers. Conversations with our sales team are typically their first touch point with an individual at the company. Because of this, it is incredibly important to be understanding of the customer’s needs, pain points, and desires. We win when they win.
- We’re in a hyper-competitive market. You must be smart, ruthless, and gritty to do sales.

To understand more about our customer personas and targets, see the Marketing section of the Internal Handbook.

- Kickoff the call by giving an agenda for the call: introduce yourself, learn about the lead, give an overview, and establish next steps. 5% of the call should be spent on this step.
- Introduce yourself: Tell them who you are, what you do and why you joined this company, Then share how you will help them during this process. 10% of the call should be spent on this step.

- Establish Next steps: If there is a fit, book a time on the call for a video demo within the next 7 days. Let them know that you will follow up with additional material via email. If there is not a fit, let them know. After the call, let marketing know that it isn’t a fit and why. This lead will be put into a nurture campaign for later when they may turn into fit. It’s also important for Marketing to improve the lead qualities. 5% of the call should be spent on this step.
- Remember that everything must be transparent. Point being, we don’t play games with people. If they ask you about the pricing model, answer honestly. If they ask you how the apps are built, answer honestly. You get the point.
