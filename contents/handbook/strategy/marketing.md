- We use a content-driven strategy to acquire inbound leads.
- We use a business development strategy to acquire outbound leads.

## Brand

- We’re building a new type of software development service. Our brand is built around strength, trust, transparency and innovation.

## Targets

### Personas

- Chief Operating Officer (COO)
- Chief Information Officer (CIO)

## Inbound: Content Marketing

### Website ()
- Goal: The number one goal of the website is to drive qualified inbound leads. The second goal of the website is to serve as a tool across the business to drive transparency into our offering to customers.
- Landing Page: An individual user should be able to understand what we do and how we do it within 30 seconds of being on our landing page. The hero panel is most important to this strategy.
- Pricing Page: We publicly display our pricing. This can change over time but we have found that it’s important to set the benchmark for our pricing model to avoid confusion down the sales funnel. This drastically reduces the number of overall leads but increases the percentage of qualified leads that sign up for a demo.

## Press
- Customer Press: With every customer, we do a joint press release or directly an article that highlights the partnership and use-case. This is meant to drive views to the customer’s application, increase brand awareness and serve as a marketing + sales tool to drive additional revenue to the business.
- Major Announcements: We do once a quarter (i.e. 4 times a year) major announcements press. This includes investments, product features, additional hires, etc. The goal of this type of press is to increase brand awareness and establish ourselves as a leader in the software development space.
